            <h><strong>Ferrari F40</strong></h>
            <p>The <strong>Ferrari F40</strong> (tipo F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car<sup>[12]</sup>
                engineered by Nicola Materazzi with styling by Pininfarina. It was built from 1987 to 1992, with the LM
                and GTE race car versions continuing production until 1994 and 1996 respectively.<sup>[2]</sup> As the
                successor to the 288 GTO (also engineered by Materazzi), it was designed to celebrate Ferrari's 40th
                anniversary and was the last Ferrari automobile personally approved by Enzo Ferrari. At the time it was
                Ferrari's fastest, most powerful, and most expensive car for sale.<sup>[15]</sup>

            <p>The car debuted with a planned production total of 400 units and a factory suggested retail price of
                approximately US$400,000 (fivefold the price of its predecessor, the 288 GTO<sup>[16]</sup>) in 1987
                ($910,000 today).<sup>[17]</sup> One of those that belonged to the Formula One driver Nigel Mansell was
                sold for the then record of £1 million in 1990, a record that stood into the
                2010s.<sup>[18]</sup><sup>[19]</sup><sup>[20]</sup><sup>[21]</sup> A total of 1,315 cars were
                manufactured with 213 units destined for the United States.<sup>[22]</sup><sup>[23]</sup></p>

        </section>
        <section id="1"><strong>Origin</strong>
            <p>As early as 1984, Materazzi had proposed to Enzo Ferrari the idea of using the Group B 4-litre category
                (2.857-litre if turbocharged) to prove the performance of new road cars which with increased power could
                no longer safely display their performance on the road in the hands of regular buyers. Since Enzo
                Ferrari no longer had control over the production part of the business, Materazzi had to obtain
                permission from the General Manager Eugenio Alzati. Permission was granted but only at the condition
                that work would take place outside of the Monday to Friday work week. A very small team thus developed
                the GTO Evoluzione on Saturdays to compete in the same class entered by the Porsche 959 in FIA Group
                B.<sup>[6][7][8][9][11]</sup></p>

            <p>However, when the FIA brought an end to the Group B category for the 1986 season, Enzo Ferrari was left
                with five 288 GTO Evoluzione development cars, and no series to enter them into competition. These were
                left for enthusiasts who might consider purchasing one until a validation driver convinced Enzo Ferrari
                that Materazzi could keep the base car concept alive and make it roadworthy.<sup>[11]</sup> Enzo's
                desire to leave a legacy in his final sports car allowed the Evoluzione program to be further developed
                to produce a car exclusively for road use. In particular Ferrari had been impressed with the development
                of recent cars which claimed back much of the performance deficit inflicted by ever more restrictive
                emissions regulations.<sup>[24]</sup> In response to the quite simple, but very expensive car with
                relatively little out of the ordinary being called a "cynical money-making exercise" aimed at
                speculators, a figure from the Ferrari marketing department was quoted as saying "We wanted it to be
                very fast, sporting in the extreme and Spartan," "Customers had been saying our cars were becoming too
                plush and comfortable." "The F40 is for the most enthusiastic of our owners who want nothing but sheer
                performance. It isn't a laboratory for the future, as the 959 is. It is not Star Wars. And it wasn't
                created because Porsche built the 959. It would have happened anyway."<sup>[25]</sup> In fact the
                reasons for the car's rawness and simplicity are very much linked to Materazzi's racing background
                (starting from the Stratos Gr.4, the Gr.5 Silhouette, then the Osella F2 and F1 cars, the 126C and
                eventually the 288 GTO).<sup>[6][7][8]</sup></p>

            <p>The body of the F40 was designed by Pietro Camardella under the supervision of, soon to retire, Aldo
                Brovarone of studio Pininfarina.<sup>[5]</sup> Nicola Materazzi meanwhile worked on evolutions of the
                engine, gearbox and other mechanical parts of the car to make them roadworthy. Many of these were well
                validated in the 288 GTO Evoluzione, from which the F40 takes many styling cues. From the beginning of
                the project on 10 June 1986 Enzo Ferrari asked for the car to be completed in a very short space of time
                (11 months) and be presented in the summer of 1987. For this reason he gave Materazzi permission to
                choose all the engineers in the team. Some of the development of the car, such as the bodywork was
                carried out at external companies like Michelotto Automobili (in Padua) who had experience in rally and
                race preparation (Stratos, GTO Evo, subsequently 333SP, 348, 355, 360, 430, 458).<sup>[26]</sup></p>

            <p><strong>Power, Torque and suspension</strong>
            <p>Power came from an enlarged, high-revving 2,936 cc (2.9 L; 179.2 cu in) version of the 288 GTO's IHI
                four-stroke 90 degree twin turbocharged and intercooled V8 engine generating a peak power output of 478
                PS (471 hp; 352 kW) at 7,000 rpm and 577 N⋅m (426 lb⋅ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm as stated by the
                manufacturer.<sup>[27]</sup> Gearing, torque curves and actual power output differed among the cars. The
                F40 did without a catalytic converter until 1990, when US regulations made them a requirement for
                emissions control reasons. The flanking exhaust pipes guide exhaust gases from each bank of cylinders
                while the central pipe guides gases released from the wastegate of the turbochargers</p>

            <p id="2"><strong>Body and interior</strong>

            <p>1991 Ferrari F40 (US Spec) (rear view)
                The body was an entirely new design by Pininfarina featuring panels made of Kevlar, carbon fibre, and
                aluminium for strength and low weight, and intense aerodynamic testing employed. Weight was further
                minimised through the use of a polycarbonate plastic windshield and windows. The cars did have moderate
                air conditioning, but had no sound system, door handles, glove box, leather trim, carpets, or door
                panels. The first 50 cars produced had sliding Lexan windows, while later cars were fitted with wind
                down windows.<sup>[28]</sup>

                All cars technically left the factory in "Rosso Corsa" colour and left hand drive. At least seven cars
                were modified and delivered to the Sultan of Brunei in right hand drive. The Sultan employed
                Pininfarina's prototype manager Paolo Garella to make modifications to the cars (colour, power, interior
                comforts).<sup>[29][30]<sup></p>
